long-description: >
  Your challenge is to build out the project and get it to look as close to the
  design as possible.


  This project focuses on your React and CSS skills, but you can use any tools
  you like to help you complete the project. So if you've got something you'd
  like to practice, feel free to give it a go.


  The website should have 


  - the information of the all the 4 cars


  - solar roof and solar panels


  - scroll snapping on the pages


  - in page navigation bar


  - smooth transitions 


  You can go through the `Readme.md` to see more details regarding the project
  and the assets folder to see the preview images of the project for desktop and
  mobile viewports.
