    There are many good ideas of projects used with the main purpose of learning
    a technology. A good side project is always one that isn't too complicated,
    but allows you to learn the basic syntax of the technologies used and a bit
    of how to structure an application with those technologies. A Pinterest
    Clone is a good example of that.
