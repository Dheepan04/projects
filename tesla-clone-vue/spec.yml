    In this Vue project your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible

    This project focuses on Vue and your UI skills. Make sure to write proper components and the transition states of the headers smoothly

    You can use any tools you like to help you complete this project. So if you've
    got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

    Your users should be able to:
    - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
    - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
    - Smooth scroll snaps when scrolling through different header sections
    - Functional (slide-able hamburger) menu in mobile viewport

    Don't forget to share your submissions with the community to get feedback. All
    the best.
