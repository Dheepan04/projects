    Your challenge is to build out the Quiz App and get it look as close to the
    design as possible. This project focuses HTML, CSS & JavaScript. Javascript
    is really important in this since it allows the app to be functional by
    validating the correct answer

    You can use any tools/technologies you like to help you complete the project. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

    Your users should be able to:

    - View Highscores 
    - Start and Complete the quiz with the functional timer by showing correct and incorrect options
    - When questions of the quiz are completed the score is set to the remaining seconds of the timer. 
    - The score should be added the to high scores in local storage 
    - The high scores should be sorted in descending order by score

    Don't forget to share your submissions with the community to get feedback. All the best.
