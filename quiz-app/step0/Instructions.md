In this step our goal is to complete building the basic markup / structure of the quiz page and styling it. The page will contain a NavBar, a Main section with a heading, description and a button to start the quiz. Nothing fancy. 

## Step 1: Create the basic markup 
    Write the html code in the `<nav>` element, it should contain two child elements, one for navigating to the highscores the second for showing the time left for completing the quiz. 

## Step 2: Create the main section of the page 
    Write the html code in the `<main>` element, it should contain three child elements, one for the heading, one for the description and one for the button to start the quiz. 

    Make sure to add the appropriate content and id's for DOM manipulation. 

## Step 3: Style the NavBar 
    Make the NavBar a flex container and space-between the elements so they are moved to the either side of the container. Add the background color given `#218380` to the navbar and make the text color white. 

## Step 4: Style the Main section
    Add proper border radius to the main section and along with the shadow. Align the content of the page to the left and set proper margin between the elements.
