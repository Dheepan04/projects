  text: This is a Crowd Funding Smart Contract project.Crowd Funding - The
    practice of funding a project or venture by raising money from a large
    number of people who each contribute a relatively small amount, typically
    via the internet. In this, we are going to use our solidity smart contract
    to perform the funding. We will have three entities here first one will be
    the manager who will deploy the smart contract, the second will be the
    contributors who will contribute to our crowdfunding, and the third will be
    the recipient to whom the donation will be made.The manager will be able to
    create multiple requests for crowdfunding. For example - The manager can
    create a request for child education, environmental protection, food
    donation, etc. And the contributors will vote for the requests raised by the
    manager. The request that will receive the highest number of votes that the
    request's recipient will receive the money contributed by the contributor.
